    <h2>Dogs CAN eat...</h2>
    <p>MEAT: Dogs can enjoy a variety of cooked, plain meats like chicken, turkey, beef, and lamb, which are rich in protein and essential nutrients. These meats should be cooked without seasoning and served without bones to avoid any risk of splintering or choking. Fish, especially salmon and sardines, are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids, benefiting their coat and overall health. However, fish should always be cooked and thoroughly deboned. Eggs, when cooked, are another great protein source and can be a healthy addition to their diet.</p>
    <p>FRUIT: Fruits are a healthy treat for dogs, with apples being a great choice for their vitamins A and C, as long as the seeds and core are removed. Blueberries are packed with antioxidants, making them a powerful snack for dogs. Bananas are high in potassium but should be given in moderation due to their sugar content. Watermelon is a hydrating and vitamin-rich fruit that can be safely offered after removing the seeds and rind.</p>
    <p>VEGETABLES: Vegetables like carrots are low in calories and beneficial for a dog's dental health and vision. Broccoli, in small amounts, can provide fiber and vitamin C, though it should be given in moderation to avoid stomach upset. Green beans, whether raw or cooked, are a low-calorie option that dogs often enjoy. Sweet potatoes are a high-fiber, beta-carotene-rich vegetable that should be cooked and served plain.</p>
    <p>GRAINS: Grains like rice, both white and brown, are easy to digest and can be particularly soothing for dogs with an upset stomach. Oatmeal, rich in fiber, is a good choice for older dogs experiencing bowel irregularity. In small amounts, dairy products can also be safe for dogs. Plain, unsweetened yogurt can provide beneficial probiotics, while cheese, especially low-fat varieties, can be given as an occasional treat, provided your dog isn’t lactose intolerant.</p>
    <p>PEANUT BUTTER: Peanut butter is a favorite treat for many dogs, offering healthy fats and protein, but it’s essential to ensure it’s unsalted and free from xylitol, an artificial sweetener that’s toxic to dogs. Pumpkin is another excellent food for dogs, particularly for its fiber content and ability to aid in digestive issues. Plain canned pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling) is the best option to offer your dog.</p>

    <h2>Dogs can NOT eat...</h2>
    <p>CHOCOLATE: Chocolate is one of the most well-known toxic foods for dogs. It contains theobromine and caffeine, which can cause severe health issues, including vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, and even death. Grapes and raisins are also highly toxic and can lead to kidney failure, even in small amounts, though the exact cause of their toxicity remains unknown. Onions and garlic, while flavorful for humans, contain compounds that can cause anemia in dogs by damaging their red blood cells, making these foods extremely dangerous even in small quantities.</p>
    <p>ALCOHOL: Alcohol is another substance that is extremely harmful to dogs. Ingesting alcohol can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, tremors, and in severe cases, death. Avocado contains persin, a compound that can cause vomiting and diarrhea in dogs. Additionally, the pit of an avocado is a choking hazard and can cause blockages in the digestive tract.</p>
    <p>CAFFEINE: Caffeine, found in coffee, tea, and energy drinks, is toxic to dogs and can result in symptoms like hyperactivity, restlessness, vomiting, and in severe cases, death. Xylitol, a sugar substitute commonly found in gum, candy, and some peanut butters, is extremely dangerous for dogs. It can cause a rapid release of insulin, leading to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), which can be life-threatening.</p>
    <p>MACADAMIA NUTS: Macadamia nuts are another food that should be avoided at all costs. Ingesting these nuts can cause symptoms like weakness, depression, vomiting, tremors, and hyperthermia in dogs. Raw meat and bones, though often touted as natural for dogs, can be hazardous. Raw meat may contain harmful bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli, while raw bones can splinter and cause choking or internal injuries.</p>
    <p>YEAST DOUGH: Yeast dough is particularly dangerous for dogs, as it can expand in the stomach, leading to painful bloating and potentially life-threatening complications. The yeast in the dough also produces ethanol, which can result in alcohol poisoning. Salt, while a necessary nutrient in small amounts, can lead to sodium ion poisoning if consumed in excess, causing vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, and seizures.</p>
    <p>NUTMEG: Nutmeg is another spice that should be kept away from dogs. It contains myristicin, which can cause hallucinations, increased heart rate, and seizures. Lastly, foods high in fat, like bacon or fried foods, can cause pancreatitis, a painful and serious condition that can lead to long-term health issues for dogs.</p>
