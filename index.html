         <h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
         <p> Fact 1: Dogs Have a Unique Nose Print: Just like human fingerprints, a dog’s nose print is unique and can be used to identify them.</p>
         <p>Fact 2: They Can Understand Human Emotions: Dogs can read your emotions by analyzing your facial expressions. They often mirror their owner’s feelings.</p>
         <p>Fact 3: Dogs Dream Like Humans: Dogs have similar sleep patterns and brain activity to humans, which means they can dream just like we do. You might see them twitching or moving their paws while they dream.</p>
         <p>Fact 4: They Have a Strong Sense of Smell: A dog’s sense of smell is between 10,000 to 100,000 times more acute than ours. They have up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses, compared to about 6 million in humans.</p>
         <p>Fact 5: Dogs Can Learn Over 1,000 Words: Some intelligent dog breeds, like Border Collies, can understand a large vocabulary, learning over 1,000 words and commands.</p>
         <p>Fact 6: Their Whiskers Help Them Navigate: Dogs use their whiskers to sense changes in their environment. These sensitive hairs pick up subtle changes in air currents, helping them detect nearby objects.</p>
         <p>Fact 7:Dogs Sweat Through Their Paws: Dogs don’t sweat through their skin like humans. Instead, they have sweat glands in their paw pads.</p>
         <p>Fact 8:They Have a ‘Sixth Sense’: Many dogs seem to have an uncanny ability to predict when their owners are coming home or can detect impending natural disasters, like earthquakes.</p>
         <p>Fact 9: Some Dogs Can Detect Medical Conditions: Dogs can be trained to detect various medical conditions, such as low blood sugar in diabetics or the presence of cancer cells.</p>
         <p>Fact 10:The Basenji Dog Doesn’t Bark: The Basenji, often referred to as the "barkless dog," doesn’t bark but instead makes a unique yodel-like sound called a "baroo." </p>
